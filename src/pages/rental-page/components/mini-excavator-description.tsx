      MINI EXCAVATOR RENTALS
    </Typography>
    <Typography gutterBottom>
      Excavators are earthmoving machines fitted with bucket attachments for digging trenches, holes and foundations. However, these large machines aren`t always the right choice for smaller, more congested job sites. That`s where mini excavators come in. This powerful and compact machinery can undertake all the duties of standard excavators with the added benefit of navigating narrow spaces with optimal maneuverability.

      OUR MINI EXCAVATORS FOR RENT
    </Typography>
    <Typography gutterBottom>
      Mini excavators are tracked machines with a heavy-duty arm connected to a bucket. Due to their small size, minimal weight and zero-tail-swing operation, these machines can more easily maneuver tight, crowded spaces than their full-sized counterparts. Mini excavators also exert minimal ground pressure, making them ideal for working on finished surfaces without producing track marks or ground damage.

      When you come to The Cat Rental Store for mini excavator rentals, you`ll have access to our extensive selection of equipment ranging from 1 to 10 metric tons. Our dependable machinery emphasizes enhanced fuel economy and compact size for greater mobility and easier transportation. These rentals are ideal for industrial jobs too small for a standard excavator but too complex to perform manually.

      Our rental mini excavators are available with net power levels between 13 and 70.3 horsepower, operating weights between 2,061 and 20,678 pounds, and digging depths of up to 183 inches.

      Zero maintenance or repairs: When you rent mini excavators, you are not responsible for performing routine maintenance or repairs — your rental dealer will handle all the necessary upkeep for you. That translates to significant cost savings for your company.
      Project-specific use: You can choose purpose-built mini excavator rentals with unique features and capabilities to ensure you have the ideal machine for your intended applications.
      Space savings: The more equipment you own, the more storage you need — but not with machine rentals. When you rent your mini excavators, you reduce your storage space requirements.
      Advanced technologies: Renting equipment from us means accessing machines with some of the most advanced technologies on the market without the upfront expenses of ownership.
      Try before you buy: If you`re considering buying a specific machine, you can test it out first to see how it fits within your fleet.
